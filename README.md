# AudioProject
A space for working on my pc volume control solution

It's currently working in python, but the visual lag is annoying. I'm trying to write up a program in C# or C++ that'll fix lag issues in Windows.

# Future Work
add python code
if sticking with python, make an app (for customizability)
develop C code
switch from arduino to PIC18 (need to find reliable way to communicate via USB first)
